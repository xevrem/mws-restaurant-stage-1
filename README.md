# Mobile Web Specialist Restaurant Reviews Project
---

## Project Overview:

This project was created as part of the Udacity Mobile Web Specialist Nanodegree. During this project, I incrementally converted a static webpage to a dynamic a mobile-ready web application.

This project utilizes:

* Responsive design for different sized displays.
* Accessible features for screen readers.
* A service worker to create a seamless offline experience.
* IndexedDB to store data for offline use.

### What do I do from here?

1. In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer.

In a terminal, you can run the website directly with python's `SimpleHTTPServer` via `python3 -m http.server 8000` or node's `http-server` via 'http-server -p 8000 -i'.

2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`
